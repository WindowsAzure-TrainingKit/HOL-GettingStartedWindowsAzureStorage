## Exercises ##

This hands-on lab includes the following exercises:

1.	[Exercise 1 - Creating a Windows Azure Storage Account ](#Exercise1)
1.	[Exercise 2 - Managing a Windows Azure Storage Account](#Exercise2)
1.	[Exercise 3 - Understanding the Windows Azure Storage Abstractions](#Exercise3)

> **Note:** Each exercise is accompanied by a starting solution. These solutions are missing some code sections that are completed through each exercise and therefore will not necessarily work if running them directly.
Inside each exercise you will also find an end folder where you find the resulting solution you should obtain after completing the exercises. You can use this solution as a guide if you need additional help working through the exercises.

Estimated time to complete this lab: **60** minutes.

> **Note:** When you first start Visual Studio, you must select one of the predefined settings collections. Every predefined collection is designed to match a particular development style and determines window layouts, editor behavior, IntelliSense code snippets, and dialog box options. The procedures in this lab describe the actions necessary to accomplish a given task in Visual Studio when using the **General Development Settings** collection. If you choose a different settings collection for your development environment, there may be differences in these procedures that you need to take into account.
